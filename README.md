#iib-ops-js

A java script module that encapsulates the IBM Integration Bus administration and operational monitoring HTTP and MQTT interfaces. With this module, you can access those capabilities via java script objects, functions and callbacks.

This works with iib-ops-rest.

The initial prototype for this repository started life as a subset of a fork of [integration-dashboard](https://github.com/hosie/integration-dashboard)
